# Project Rules

## Prompt Logging

Every time you receive a new instruction or prompt, append it to prompts.txt in the project root with a timestamp (ISO 8601) and a brief summary of what you did in response. Create the file if it doesn't exist. Keep this log updated throughout all sessions.

## Flow

This project uses Flow skills. Say a phrase to load its skill; the installed `flow` skill describes this block. Delete the block to opt out.

Do the work yourself: CLI, then MCP, then API, then browser. Hand the user only sign-in, secrets, payment, consent, or permission changes, once, as one command each (`write-agents` Tools).

| Say                                                  | Skill       |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| "explore this"                                       | `explore`   |
| "interview me"                                       | `interview` |
| "grill this"                                         | `grill`     |
| "spec it"                                            | `to-spec`   |
| "share the draft"                                    | `to-spec`   |
| "break it down"                                      | `to-tasks`  |
| "build it"                                           | `build`     |
| "check it against the spec"                          | `review`    |
| "ship it" (add "local" or "with GitHub" for one run) | `ship`      |
| "push it"                                            | `push`      |
| "update the docs"                                    | `flow`      |

## This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
